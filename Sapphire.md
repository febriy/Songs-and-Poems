# Sapphire

## Current Status
[BOX 1: I think this might work]\
Singing with the girl clad in blue\
Duet that made my heart ring\
something shining\
...sometime in September\
(well..)\
I guess this isn't a mistake\
What a great couple we'll make\
(I thought)\
Maybe! Maybe you're my sapphire\

[BOX 2: I become sure]\
Sitting by the deep blue ocean\
barefoot on the field of sand \
see, our hands \
...knitted by red fire\
Singing songs of devotion\
This is my confession\
(I say)\
Yes! You are my Sapphire\

[BOX 3: would you be my sapphire?]\
The day that I most desire\
I've waited for this all my life\
Oh my dear darling  (wife)\
...You're the one I admire\
Hear me out, this one thing true\
I love you so,I really do\
(Tell me)\
Darling! Would you be my sapphire?\

[Bridge]\
So please smile... my Sapphire....\
We'll walk down the aile..... my Sapphire!\

## Link to recording

## Motivation
I've decided that this will be a song of 'an excited declaration' - Inspired by Treasure, I wanna hold your hand, flashlight. 

This song is titled Sapphire. This is about how my darling is like a precious gemstone which entices me, that I want to own for myself. 

## Features/ Notes
Create sense-bound lines. Let listeners put their own 'stuff' into your song. Give them emotional access. Try to start with sense-bound language, because those lines will colour everything else below it and even if you use abstarct language, the sense bound language in the other part of the song will colour it. <Just start writing. Lines are provisional, and can change again>

This song declares that shereen is my sapphire
BOX 1: Wow sapphire you look so so mesmerising
Concepts (as you think of ideas, think too about your keyword):
- Sapphire, you are so precious, what a beautiful shiny gemstone you are, rare, unique, deep blue. (
- Sapphire, you sparkle brightly, mesmerising me. I am captured in awe of you. (radiance, glitter)
- Sapphire, you dazzle me 
- Sapphire, you reminded me of the blue ocean, by which we spent our time, looking at the sky and ocean. 

The key-words have to also rhyme with other potential key words

BOX 2: Wow sapphire you dont just look mesmerising, you are also strong and awesome on the inside
Concepts:
- Wow sapphire formed from the deep earth, from tons of pressure. You are like a miracle!
- you are the most resilient rock there is, beautiful on the outside, strong on the inside, so awesome!

MOOD: energetic, joyful, playful NOT romantic, restful, touching
