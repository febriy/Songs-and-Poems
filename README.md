# Songs-and-Poems

## Motivation
I find that using git to write out my songs and poems are useful, because typically my work are not done in the first try. It takes coming back to the work again and again. Therefore a version control system like this one will be useful for me. 

## Structure
To start, everything will be in this folder. All info related to the song will be in one file.

## Commands
Just to remind myself:
- git clone < https link > : Copy a repo into my computer
- git status : Look at what has been done in the local repo
- git commit -a -m " < comments > ": committing the changes to local repo. -a means all change. -m is to include a message
- git push < destination: remote > < branch >: Push changes to Github (remote server) (e.g. git push origin master)
- git add < file name > : add a file to be tracked by git

- git config --list : View your git configurations
- git log -2 : List changes made in previous 2 steps
- git remote -v : list the remote location associated with git
