# Till the end of day

## Current Status:

[Verse 1]\
This ring\
Remember the time\
Remember the words\
That we've said

We'll stay\
For better and worse\
In sickness and in health\
Rich and poor

[Verse 2]\
This life\
The ups and the downs\
The strain and the pain\
They will test us

Our life\
Will echo this vow\
Will rhyme with His love\
With His command

[Verse 3]\
One day\
When we're ninety nine\
The ring on our fingers\
(will) lose its shine

That's fine\
Our heart's intertwined\
Our hair will turn silver\
Shimmering crown

[Chorus]\
What God has joined, let no one separates\
We're living not by our strength, we'll turn to Him instead\
For He is here, I'm confident to say\
It starts today, till the end of days 3x

[Pre-Chorus]\
Two lifes\
Used to be apart\
Decided to hold on\
Walk side by side
