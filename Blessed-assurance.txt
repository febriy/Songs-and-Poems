# Blessed Assurance

## Motivation
- I was feeling shame due to comparison and thinking that I'm not good enough
- Reminded that my worth is given by my creator, not performance or anything else

## Features
- I wanted the chorus to be a declarative THIS IS MY BLESSED ASSURANCE, and this will be followed by the second line answering the first line -> 'What blessed assurace are you talking about?'
- The last 2 lines, I want it to be visual and extreme 'You've ripped out my shame away' -> the idea of ripping out, leaving one empty. So what will fill it? -> Oh Lord, you are here to stay.


## Current Status
